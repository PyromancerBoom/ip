## Introduction

ðŸ¤– **WannaBeSkynet** - Get your tasks efficiently managed by a (wannabe) sentient AI bot.

> "Your data is safe with me, I definitely won't use it at all." - WannaBeSkynet

Tired of the mortal struggle of remembering tasks? **WannaBeSkynet** is here to offload your memory onto silicon. This bot is a task manager that will help you keep track of your to-dos with a dash of **humorously** offensive charm.

## Get started in 3 simple steps

1. **Download the jar**: [Click here](https://github.com/PyromancerBoom/ip/releases/tag/A-Release) to download WannaBeSkynet.
2. **Launch**: Execute the jar file to awaken the bot. `java -jar bot.jar`
   - You need to have Java installed on your machine to run the bot.
   - The bot will create a `data` folder in the same directory as the jar file to store your tasks.
3. **Happy Tasking**: Start adding tasks and managing them with the bot.

## Features

Bot commands are case-insensitive, so don't worry about getting the capitalization right. Along with this, the bot supports **friendly syntax**, that is, shorthand commands - so you can type `l` instead of `list` and `m` instead of `mark`.

You can also work across multiple Operating Systems, as the bot is designed to be **cross-platform** compatible. The only requirement is that you have Java installed on your machine.

Besides that, this bot is designed to be **user-friendly** It will respond to your commands with a touch of personality.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you'll see a GUI.

#### Hope you have fun!
