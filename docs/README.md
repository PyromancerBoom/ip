> "Your data is safe with me, I definitely won't use it at all. Trust." - WannaBeSkynet

Tired of the mortal struggle of remembering tasks? **WannaBeSkynet** is here to offload your memory onto silicon. This bot is a task manager that will help you keep track of your to-dos with a dash of **humorously** offensive charm.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the jar**: [Click here](#) to download WannaBeSkynet.
2. **Launch**: Execute the jar file to awaken the bot. `java -jar bot.jar`
3. **Discover Commands**: Type `help` or `h` for my command list.

## Features

Bot commands are case-insensitive, so don't worry about getting the capitalization right. Along with this, the bot supports **friendly syntax**, that is, shorthand commands - so you can type `l` instead of `list` and `m` instead of `mark`.

Here's a list of commands you can use to interact with the bot:

### 1. Adding Tasks of multiple types

This bot supports three types of tasks: **To-Do**, **Deadline**, and **Event**.

#### To-Do Task

- Use: `todo <task_name>` or `t <task_name>`
- Example: `todo buy groceries`

#### Deadline Task

- Use: `deadline` or `d <task_name> /by <time>`
- Example: `d Steal moon by July 20 2029 20:00`
- Note: The time must be in the format `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm` (e.g. `Jul 20 2029 20:00`)

#### Event Task

- Use: `event` or `e <event_name> /at <time>`
- Example: `e attend meetings /from Aug 13 2029 10:00 /to Aug 13 2029 23:00`
- Note: The time must be in the format `MMM dd yyyy HH:mm` (e.g. `Aug 13 2029 10:00`)

### 2. Viewing and searching Tasks

#### Listing all Tasks

To view the grand list of your tasks:

- This would include all your tasks, marked or unmarked.

#### Find Tasks

To search for tasks containing a specific keyword:

- Use: `find` or `f <keyword>`
- Example: `f work`
- This is case-insensitive.

### 3. Managing Tasks

#### Mark Task as Done

- Use: `mark` or `m <task_number>`
- Example: `m 1`

#### Unmark Task as Done
